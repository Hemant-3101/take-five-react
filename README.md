In this project we will be displaying 5 numbers with a twist.

On initial load show numbers from 1 to 5 in indiviual divs with id="number-display" and two buttons.
First button will have id="back-button" and text "Prev Page" which will be disabled by default(or whenever we are on first page i.e showing numbers from 1 to 5)
second button will have id="next-button" and text "Next Page"

On clicking Next Page button we will display the next 5 numbers, i.e from 6 to 10.
And since we are on page 2 , the Prev Page button will be enabled, and upon clicking that it takes 
you back to original 1-5 numbers and also disbables the back button since we can't go back from page 1.
